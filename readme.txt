== Description ==

Add 360 degree image-/panorama-/sphere-support to Wordpress. This might be a absolut simple and working Plugin ... and it is.

Well, this plugin was scripted for a customer and worked for him. I played around with some other 360Â° sources, browsers - worked.
U'll find the default-section under the options-section.

== Installation ==

This plugin comes out of the box. Just install, activate and enjoy. I added some very simple customize support.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.2 =
* just scripted
* tested with default browsers and different image-sources
